# TRACKiT
This is my final year project This project entails coming up with a hardware based laptop tracking system which will have a GPS receiver, 
GSM module and a micro-controller circuit like Arduino or Raspberry Pi. I am not designing this components from scratch but I will be 
integrating them so that they work together where a user can know the location of his/her laptop by simply sending a message to the 
SIM card in the GSM chip. I will also be creating a mobile application that will allow the user to control the complex tasks of the 
tracking system. The GPS receiver will be used to calculate the longitude and latitude data which it then forwards to the GSM chip 
through the controller circuit and this data will be then made available to the user through SMS service and from the mobile application.
Communication between the user and the laptop tracking system will happen through AT commands sent in form of SMS
